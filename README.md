## Organization

Solutions are organized by data structure/algorithm type for easy navigation:
- **Arrays**: Array manipulation, two pointers, sliding window
- **Strings**: String processing, pattern matching
- **Linked Lists**: Node manipulation, cycle detection
- **Stacks & Queues**: LIFO/FIFO operations
- **Trees**: Binary trees, BST operations, traversals
- **Graphs**: BFS, DFS, shortest paths
- **Dynamic Programming**: Memoization, tabulation
- **Sorting**: Various sorting algorithms
- **Searching**: Binary search, linear search

## Usage

Each solution includes:
- Problem statement reference
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Multiple approaches when applicable
- Test cases

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the specific problem directory
3. Compile and run the Java files
4. Review the solutions and test cases

## Notes

- Solutions are implemented with clarity and efficiency in mind
- Each file includes comprehensive comments
- Test cases demonstrate various edge cases
- Solutions follow Java best practices and naming conventions
